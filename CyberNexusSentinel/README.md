# CyberNexus Sentinel (AI Defense HUD)

Developed by **Raphasha27**, CyberNexus Sentinel is an AI-driven cybersecurity command center designed to protect critical infrastructure through real-time threat detection and autonomous neutralization.

## 🛡️ Core Vision
In an era of increasing digital threats, CyberNexus Sentinel acts as the "Brain" of a SOC (Security Operations Center), using neural networks to filter anomalies and shield sensitive nodes across South Africa.

## 🔥 Key Intelligence
- **Live Threat Repository**: Real-time logging of neutralized intrusions (DDoS, Brute Force, Phishing).
- **Node Topology**: Visual monitoring of network health across regional data centers (Joburg, Cape Town, KZN).
- **AI Shielding**: Autonomous firewall orchestration that adapts to attack patterns.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Cyberpunk SOC HUD)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Interface**: Simulated threat detection engine.

## 🚦 Deployment
1. Navigate to the `CyberNexusSentinel` folder.
2. Execute the initialization protocol:
   ```bash
   python run_nexus.py
   ```
