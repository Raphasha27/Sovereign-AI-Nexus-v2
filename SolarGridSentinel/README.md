# SolarGrid Sentinel (Decentralized Energy AI)

Developed by **Raphasha27**, SolarGrid Sentinel is an AI-driven platform designed to fight power instability in South Africa by enabling community-based energy generation, storage, and arbitrage.

## 🔋 Core Mission
South Africa's energy grid is under immense pressure. SolarGrid Sentinel uses Agentic AI to monitor community solar production, store excess energy in decentralized battery networks, and "arbitrage" that power back to where it's needed most—creating both resilience and new revenue streams for local households.

## 🔥 Key Intelligence
- **Community Energy Flow**: Real-time monitoring of generation versus consumption.
- **Agentic Trade Ledger**: Automated energy trades between clusters to balance load-shedding risks.
- **Revenue Arbitrage**: Turning excess sunlight into ZAR for community members.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Energy-Flow UI)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Visuals**: AI-generated high-fidelity grid conceptualizations.

## 🚦 Deployment Protocol
1. Navigate to the `SolarGridSentinel` folder.
2. Activate the grid:
   ```bash
   python run_grid.py
   ```
