# Agri-Nexus AI (The Smart Harvest Shield)

Developed by **Raphasha27**, Agri-Nexus AI is a mission-critical platform designed to secure South Africa's food supply chain through intelligent yield optimization and market arbitrage.

## 🌽 Core Mission
Food security is a foundation of social stability. Agri-Nexus AI solves two critical problems: 
1. **Pre-consumer Spoilage**: High-severity waste in rural clusters.
2. **Market Exploitation**: Bridging the gap so smallholder farmers get a fair price directly from retailers.

## 🔥 Key Intelligence
- **Harvest Guard AI**: Deploys the mobile cooling and routing solutions to prevent spoilage.
- **Direct Arbitrage Engine**: Links farmers to urban markets via transparent blockchain-ready logic.
- **Regional Cluster Tracking**: Real-time optimization tracking for the Limpopo Fruit Belt, Free State Grain Hub, and more.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Nature-Tech / Emerald Aesthetic)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Logic**: Purpose-driven intervention simulation.

## 🚦 Deployment
1. Navigate to the `AgriNexusAI` folder.
2. Activate the harvest shield:
   ```bash
   python run_agri.py
   ```
