Welcome to the **Raphasha27 AI Sovereign Nexus**, a decentralized, agentic AI ecosystem designed to manage and protect the critical infrastructure and socio-economic vitals of South Africa. Built with a 7-pillar architecture, this system integrates localized AI responses with global standards and Gemini-powered strategic reasoning.

---

## 🌌 The 7-Pillar Architecture

The Nexus is divided into seven autonomous yet synchronized pillars, each with its own **FastAPI backend** and **Vite/React frontend**.

1.  **🌍 EcoArbitrage AI (Social Harmony)**: Bridges socio-economic fairness with UNESCO/WHO standards.
2.  **📦 Kasi-Logistics 2.0 (Global Trade)**: Connects township merchants directly to international ports (Rotterdam, Dubai) via neural trade corridors.
3.  **🛡️ CyberNexus Sentinel (Cyber Fortress)**: A Zero-Trust infrastructure shield with autonomous threat neutralization.
4.  **☀️ SolarGrid Sentinel (Energy Sovereignty)**: Manages decentralized energy consensus and protects against grid collapse.
5.  **🌽 Agri-Nexus AI (Food Security)**: Optimizes harvest yields and eliminates market middleman exploitation.
6.  **🏥 HealthNexus AI (Predictive Wellness)**: Outbreak suppression and community health vitals synced with WHO.
7.  **💧 AquaNexus AI (Water Sovereignty)**: Protects dams, detects municipal leaks, and ensures neurally-filtered water quality.

## 🧠 The Sovereign Brain (Central Intelligence)

The **Master Command Center** features the "Sovereign Brain"—a strategic advisor powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**. 

-   **Aggregated Analysis**: The Brain polls all 7 pillars in real-time.
    -   **Cross-Sector Reasoning**: It analyzes how a failure in one sector (e.g., Energy) affects others (e.g., Logistics or Health).
    -   **Crisis Mode**: If a critical failure is detected (like a total grid collapse), the entire HUD enters **Red Alert Mode**, and the AI forces open a strategic intervention plan.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, Google Generative AI (Gemini), HTTPX.
-   **Frontend**: React, Vite, Vanilla CSS (Premium Glassmorphism), Lucide React.
-   **Orchestration**: Python-based Master Run script for simultaneous 16-process management.

---

## 🚦 Installation & Launch

### 1. Set up Environment
Ensure you have Python and Node.js installed.
Create a `.env` file in `MasterCommandCenter/backend/`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 2. Launch the System
Run the master orchestrator from the root directory:
```bash
python master_run.py
```

### 3. Access the Dashboards
-   **Master Command Center**: [http://localhost:5180](http://localhost:5180)
-   *All individual pillars are accessible via the Master HUD.*
