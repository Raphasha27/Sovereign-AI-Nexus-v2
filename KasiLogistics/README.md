# Kasi-Logistics 2.0 (Township Connector)

Developed by **Raphasha27**, Kasi-Logistics 2.0 is an AI-powered trade ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between South African township entrepreneurs and global supply chains.

## 📦 Core Mission
Traditional logistics often fails the "last mile" in complex township environments. Kasi-Logistics 2.0 uses agentic AI to optimize local routing and provides a "Global Bridge" to help township products (crafts, food, textiles) find international markets.

## 🔥 Key Features
- **Smart Hub Network**: Real-time monitoring of township-based distribution centers.
- **Global Trade Monitor**: End-to-end tracking from Kasi to international cities.
- **AI Dispatch**: Predictive routing for township delivery hubs.

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Sunset/High-Tech UI)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **AI Analytics**: Integrated supply chain optimization models.

## 🚀 How to Launch
1. Navigate to the `KasiLogistics` folder.
2. Run the master script:
   ```bash
   python run_kasi.py
   ```
